# Hand-Gesture-Steering-and-Movement-Control

This is a Computer Vision project made possible because of OpenCV and MediaPipe.

Current features :

- Keep both hands horizontal to move forward
- Keep right hand down and left hand up to steer right
- Keep left hand down and right up to steer left
- Put thumbs close to palm to make a drift if on a vehicle or jump if walking/running

The program can be used for other applications as well, key bindings have to be taken into consideration.

P.S : FOR IMPORVEMENTS | BUG FIXES | NEW IDEAS YOU CAN FORK THIS REPOSITORY AND MAKE A PULL REQUEST FOR CHANGES.
